# Classes
All module classes go in this folder.

Note that `Build-Module` isn't intelligent about the order it assembles classes in - it simply uses alphabetical order - so parent classes may be put after child classes, which won't load properly.  To avoid this, if build order matters, classes or folders must be manually prefix with numbers or other alphanumeric sorting.
